# 🎯 Demo Readiness Checklist

**Last Updated:** Just now (after fixing ES|QL query issues)

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (What's Working)

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **ES|QL Queries Fixed** - All syntax errors resolved
  - ✅ Fixed `CASE WHEN` → `CASE()` syntax
  - ✅ Fixed `@timestamp` sorting after `BUCKET()` grouping
  - ✅ Queries now execute successfully without errors
- ✅ **Elasticsearch Connection** - Successfully connected and querying
- ✅ **Real Data Retrieval** - Getting actual data from Elasticsearch (not mock data)
- ✅ **Issue Detection Logic** - Analyzing reviews and sentiment correctly
- ✅ **API Endpoint** - `/api/analyze-product` working

### Frontend
- ✅ **Product Selector** - Dropdown with products
- ✅ **Agent Status Component** - Shows multi-step progress
- ✅ **Results Display** - Shows issues and actions
- ✅ **UI Integration** - All components connected

### Backend
- ✅ **API Route** - `/app/api/analyze-product/route.ts` complete
- ✅ **ES|QL Query Builders** - Both queries working:
  - `buildRecentReviewsQuery()` - ✅ Working
  - `buildTrendQuery()` - ✅ Working (fixed)
- ✅ **Data Processing** - Converting ES|QL results to issues
- ✅ **Issue Creation** - Code ready to create issues in Elasticsearch

### Elastic Setup
- ✅ **Elastic Cloud** - Account configured
- ✅ **Customer Reviews Index** - Created with 615 reviews
- ✅ **Custom Tools** - Created in Agent Builder:
  - `search_recent_reviews`
  - `analyze_sentiment_trends`
- ✅ **Custom Agent** - `voc-analysis-agent` created

## 🧪 TESTING NEEDED (Verify Before Demo)

### Critical Tests
- ✅ **Test with Product A** - Should detect issues (has most complaints)
  - [x] Select "Product A" in UI ✅
  - [x] Click "Analyze Reviews" ✅
  - [x] Verify issues are detected ✅
  - [x] Verify evidence/reviews are shown ✅
  - **Status:** ✅ WORKING - Issues detected successfully!
- ✅ **Test with Product B** - Should show "No issues" (we saw this working)
  - [x] Already tested - shows "No critical issues detected" ✅
- ⏳ **Verify Issue Creation** - Check if issues are saved to Elasticsearch
  - [ ] Check Kibana Discover → `issues` index
  - [ ] Verify issue records are created
  - [ ] Verify issue data is correct
- ✅ **End-to-End Flow** - Complete user journey
  - [x] Select product ✅
  - [x] See progress indicators ✅
  - [x] See results appear ✅
  - [x] Verify all data displays correctly ✅
  - **Status:** ✅ WORKING - Full flow tested with Product A!

### Edge Cases
- ⏳ **Empty Results Handling** - When no issues found
  - [x] Already working - shows "No critical issues detected" ✅
- ⏳ **Error Handling** - If Elasticsearch is down
  - [ ] Test with invalid credentials
  - [ ] Verify graceful fallback (currently falls back to mock data)

## 🔧 POTENTIAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Known Issues
1. ⚠️ **Trend Analysis Timestamp** (Line 190 in route.ts)
   - **Issue:** After `BUCKET(@timestamp, 1d)`, column name might be different
   - **Status:** May need to check actual column name returned
   - **Priority:** Medium (only affects trend calculation)
   - **Action:** Test with Product A and check if trend is calculated correctly

2. ⚠️ **Agent Builder API** (Not currently used)
   - **Issue:** Agent Builder REST API endpoints return 404
   - **Status:** Using direct ES|QL queries instead (still valid for demo)
   - **Priority:** Low (direct queries work fine)
   - **Note:** This is documented in `API_ENDPOINT_ISSUE.md`

## 🎬 DEMO PREPARATION

### What to Show
- [ ] **Problem Statement** - Customer reviews scattered, hard to track
- [ ] **Solution Demo** - VOC Radar analyzes automatically
- [ ] **Live Flow** - Select Product A → Watch analysis → See issues
- [ ] **Automation** - Show issue record created automatically
- [ ] **Value** - Actionable insights with evidence

### Demo Script
- [ ] Write talking points
- [ ] Practice the flow
- [ ] Prepare screenshots/recordings
- [ ] Time the demo (aim for 3-5 minutes)

### Optional Polish
- [ ] Better loading animations
- [ ] Error messages in UI
- [ ] Success notifications
- [ ] Visual improvements
